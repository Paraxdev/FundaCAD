// Writing a driving length / diameter straight into the geometry, for machines
// with no constraint solver.
//
// A line's length and a circle's diameter are the only two sketch dimensions
// that go through a solver constraint rather than editing coordinates (see
// SketchMode.editDimension; rectangle W/H and line angle are direct writes). So
// where the solver's WASM will not start, those two were the only dimensions
// that silently did NOTHING: the constraint was recorded, never solved, and the
// shape kept the size it was drawn at. That is exactly how it reached us, from a
// Windows user on 0.1.100 whose WebView2 refused to compile WebAssembly:
// "when creating a circle I am unable to put in a new value for the dimension.
// Other shapes seem to work fine."
//
// This is a stand-in, not a solver. The constraints are left in place, so once a
// real solver is available it drives the geometry properly and a sketch authored
// here is indistinguishable from one authored on a working machine.

 *
 *  Returns the constraint list with the driving dim upserted (dedup by target,

 *  caller to fall back to entityDims' own write(). */
