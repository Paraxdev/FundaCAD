// Headless re-solve of a CLOSED sketch after a parameter edit changed one of
// its dimension-constraint values. The open sketch handles itself live
// (SketchMode.syncParamValues); this runs for every other affected sketch so a
// param-driven dim actually moves geometry instead of being decorative.
//
// Failure semantics (plan R2): a solve that fails or reports conflicts keeps
// the OLD coordinates, the param edit still lands, and the caller surfaces
// the sketch id so the user hears about it (never blocks the edit).
