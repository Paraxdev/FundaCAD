// Accelerated raycasting for the body meshes.
//
// Every `pointermove` runs a hover pick, and three.js's stock raycast is a
// brute-force scan of every triangle. Measured in a real browser on a hex
// texture over a 40mm cylinder: 50,074 triangles, 2.60ms MEDIAN per pick
// (p95 2.80, max 3.90) against 0.00ms for the same cylinder untextured. At one
// or more pointermove events per frame that is most of a 60fps budget spent
// before anything is drawn, which is why applying a texture tanked the frame
// rate on hardware that renders 50k triangles without noticing.
//
// three-mesh-bvh replaces the scan with a tree walk. It is already a dependency
// of three other projects here, so it is not a new vendor to trust.
//
// This module patches THREE.Mesh.prototype as a SIDE EFFECT of being imported.
// render.ts imports scheduleRaycastIndex from it, and render.ts is pulled in by
// viewport.ts at app load, so the patch is in place long before any pointermove
// can raycast. picking.ts additionally imports flushRaycastIndex.

 *  REORDERS the geometry's index buffer to group triangles spatially, and this
 *  whole app keys its face model on triangle index: `faceIds[t]`, the
 *  `faceTriangles` map, and the highlighter's per-face vertex painting. With the
 *  default build a cylinder's three faces each ended up owning a scrambled mix
 *  of the other faces' triangles (measured: faceId 0 got 69 bottom + 55 lateral
 *  + 18 top), so hover painted a nonsense patch and picking returned the wrong
 *  face. Indirect mode keeps its own ordering in a side buffer and leaves the
 *  index alone.
 *

 *  normally use scheduleRaycastIndex (below) rather than this directly, the
 *  build is deferred past the first paint, not skipped. */

//
// Building every body's BVH inline during setModel measured ~0.7 s of the 2.26 s
// of frozen main thread after a large reply lands (3,071 bodies). A fully LAZY
// build is still the wrong answer, it just moves the stall into the user's
// first mouse move, which is worse than a stall during a load they are already
// waiting through.
//
// So: build after the first paint instead. `scheduleRaycastIndex` queues the
// geometry, one rAF hands the browser its frame, then idle callbacks drain the
// queue in deadline-bounded chunks. The model appears ~0.7 s sooner and the
// trees are ready a frame or two later.
//
// `flushRaycastIndex` closes the only hole: a pick that arrives before the queue
// drains. Without it three-mesh-bvh would silently fall back to the stock
// brute-force raycast, correct, but a scan of millions of triangles. The picker
// calls it first, and it is free once the queue is empty.
