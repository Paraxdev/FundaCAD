// Progressive display: putting a chunked rebuild reply on screen as it arrives.
//
// The rest of the app only ever sees a FINISHED model. This is the one place
// that draws a partial one, and it exists because the alternative is worse:
// without it a large assembly shows the PREVIOUS document until the whole reply
// lands, which on the reference file is minutes of a frozen, wrong scene.
//
// The rule that keeps this safe: THE STREAM IS A PURE ACCELERATOR, THE COMMIT IS
// AUTHORITATIVE. Everything built here is keyed by body id and etag, exactly as
// viewport.setModel() builds it, so when the completed build finally arrives,
// setModel's ordinary etag diff finds every body already present, reuses all of
// them, and runs its whole-model passes once. If a chunk was dropped or this
// file got something wrong, setModel simply builds the missing bodies itself.
// Nothing here can produce a model the commit would not have produced anyway.
