"""Configure OpenCASCADE shared-memory parallelism (SMP) once per process.

OCCT is **CPU-only**, there is no GPU path for booleans or meshing. The lever
for "blazingly fast" is therefore scaling across every core/thread:

  * meshing, `BRepMesh_IncrementalMesh` fans faces across OCCT's thread pool
  * booleans, `BOPAlgo` (fuse/cut/intersect) run multi-threaded

Both draw their worker threads from one global `OSD_ThreadPool`. We point that
pool at all logical CPUs (24 on a 5900X) and flip the parallel-by-default flags,
so a single configure() at startup makes every rebuild use the whole machine.
Override the thread count with the `VERXA_THREADS` env var.

`configure()` is idempotent and must run in *each* process that touches OCCT,
the server process AND every rebuild worker (see server.py's executor initializer).
