"""Derive the tree an export should carry, from the document plus its built bodies.

Deliberately format-agnostic and separate from `exporters.py`: 3MF `<components>`
and glTF's node hierarchy want the SAME derivation, and a fourth copy of the
assembly walk is exactly what `step_assembly.py`'s "one walk, one source of
truth" note exists to prevent.

Why this is small: `build123d.export_step` is NOT the flat `STEPControl` writer
it was assumed to be. It builds an XCAF document via `_create_xde(...,
auto_naming=True)` and writes with `STEPCAFControl_Writer`
(exporters3d.py:370-378), and `set_name_and_color` already writes
`TDataStd_Name` onto BOTH the instance label and the referred label "so STEP
PRODUCT names persist", which is the name-drop workaround this project
otherwise had to hand-roll. So all that is needed here is a `Compound` whose
`children` mirror the assembly, with `.label` and `.color` set. The XCAF work is
upstream's.

Two hazards this module exists to contain:

1. `Compound(children=[...])` MUTATES each child's `.parent`, and setting
   `.label` mutates the shape object too. The shapes handed to an export are the
   LIVE ones from `rebuild_cached`, also referenced by `builder._CACHE` prefix
   snapshots in a long-lived worker, re-parenting them would corrupt the
   rebuild cache. Every leaf is therefore re-wrapped as a FRESH build123d object
   around the same `TopoDS_Shape` before anything is set on it.

2. Per-occurrence placement lives in each leaf's `TopLoc_Location`, not in its
   coordinates (`.Moved()` sets the location field). Measured on asm_nested: 6 of
   7 leaves carry a non-identity location. Nothing here may strip it, or every
   instance of a repeated subassembly collapses onto the same spot.
