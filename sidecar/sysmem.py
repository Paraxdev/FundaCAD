"""sysmem.py, available physical memory, on all three platforms, without psutil.

`psutil` is NOT available to the shipped sidecar. It appears in the dev lockfile
only as a transitive dependency of ipython, so importing it here would work on a
developer's machine and fail in front of a user. Each platform is read directly
instead:

  Linux    /proc/meminfo MemAvailable, the kernel's own estimate of what can be
           allocated without swapping. NOT MemFree, which excludes reclaimable
           page cache and on a warm machine reads near zero while gigabytes are
           genuinely available.
  macOS    vm_stat: free + inactive + speculative + purgeable pages. Inactive and
           purgeable are reclaimable under pressure, so counting only "free" would
           under-report just as badly as MemFree does.
  Windows  GlobalMemoryStatusEx().ullAvailPhys via ctypes.

EVERY function here returns None rather than raising or guessing. An unknown
memory figure must leave the caller free to proceed: refusing an import because a
probe failed would be a worse failure than the OOM it was meant to prevent.

The parsers take their input as an argument so all three can be tested on any
machine, otherwise two thirds of this file would only ever run in production.
