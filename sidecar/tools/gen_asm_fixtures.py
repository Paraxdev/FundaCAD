"""Generate small STEP assembly fixtures for the Phase C assembly-tree work.

Every .step file already in this repo is a single flat part: all nine have
`NEXT_ASSEMBLY_USAGE_OCCURRENCE = 0` and exactly one `PRODUCT_DEFINITION`. So
there is nothing committed that exercises a named XCAF product tree, and the
356 MiB reference assembly is unimportable until the cap raise lands. These
fixtures fill that gap.

Each one isolates a case the import path has to get right:

  asm_flat           3 single-solid products, depth 1, the baseline.
  asm_multisolid     "M3 Nut (x3)": ONE product label holding 3 disjoint solids,
                     plus a single-solid "Plate". The tree must not flatten this
                     to 4 anonymous bodies nor collapse it to 1.
  asm_nested         Depth 3, with one subassembly instanced TWICE at different
                     world positions. This is the fixture that catches leaves
                     being harvested in their parent's frame instead of world
                     space, a bug that is invisible at depth 1.
  asm_colors         3 products with their own colour + 1 with none under a
                     coloured parent, which is the case that catches reading
                     build123d's inherited `.color` getter instead of the label.
  asm_empty_product  A named product with faces and ZERO solids, the shape of
                     the 11 products the importer silently drops today.

    a name attached that way is DROPPED by STEPCAFControl_Writer for simple
    solids. Verified, the product comes back out of the file as
    "Open CASCADE STEP translator 7.9 1.1", while compound products written the
    same way keep their names, which is a confusing thing to debug twice.
    Adding the shape through AddComponent and naming the REFERRED label writes
    correctly for both. The cost is that placement has to be baked into `shape`
    instead of passed as a TopLoc_Location; only sub-assemblies, which do keep
    their names, are instanced with an explicit location.

    makeAssembly stays off, which is what keeps a multi-solid compound as ONE
    named product rather than an assembly of anonymous children, the whole
