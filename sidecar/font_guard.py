"""Make `import build123d` survive an unreadable system font.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
build123d/text.py runs, at MODULE SCOPE:

    available_fonts = FontManager().available_fonts

so merely importing build123d walks the OS font directories and hands every
file it finds to fontTools' ``TTFont()``. ``FontManager.register_folder`` has no
per-file error handling, so ONE unreadable font aborts the whole import, and
with it the geometry sidecar, before any geometry runs.

That is not hypothetical. Four field reports across 0.1.82, 0.1.85 and 0.1.100,
all Windows, all "the geometry engine could not start on this computer", in two
flavours:

  * ``TTLibFileIsCollectionError: specify a font number between 0 and 3``, a
    TrueType Collection whose extension is not ``.ttc``. build123d routes only
    the ``.ttc`` extension to ``TTCollection``, so a collection named ``.ttf``
    reaches ``TTFont()``, which refuses to guess a face.
  * ``TTLibError: Not a TrueType or OpenType font (bad sfntVersion)``, a file
    caught by the ``*ttf``/``*otf`` glob that is not an sfnt font at all.

Linux and macOS escape it in practice because their font directories rarely
hold either kind of file. C:\\Windows\\Fonts holds both.

HOW IT WORKS
------------
``register_folder`` finds candidates with ``glob.glob(...)``, an attribute
lookup at call time, on the stdlib module. So for the duration of the build123d
import, and only for patterns that are looking for fonts, ``glob.glob`` is
wrapped to drop files that fontTools would refuse. build123d then never sees
them, and nothing in build123d is patched.

Call `ensure()` before anything imports build123d. It is idempotent and cheap
after the first call (build123d is in sys.modules by then).

WHY A CALL AND NOT AN IMPORT SIDE EFFECT
----------------------------------------
The obvious shape, `import font_guard` at the top of every module that imports
build123d, was the first version, and it was wrong for a reason that has
nothing to do with fonts. `builder._env_sig` hashes the BYTES of builder.py,
geom_select.py, tessellate.py and selector_tuning.json into the mesh-cache key,
so adding even an import line to two of them changes the key and costs every
user a full cold rebuild of every document. On a large assembly that is minutes.
Guarding from server.py's `_worker_init` instead reaches every worker (it is the
pool initializer, so no geometry job can run without it) and leaves the four
signature files untouched.

The check is the first four bytes of each file, not a full parse: a real parse
of every system font would add seconds to every cold start. That covers both
observed failures but cannot prove a file with a valid signature will parse, so
a failed import is retried once with system-font scanning disabled entirely.
Losing font enumeration degrades sketch text; failing to import loses the app.
