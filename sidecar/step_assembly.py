"""Read a STEP file's XCAF product tree: names, colours, placement.

Why this exists instead of `build123d.import_step`: that function is a fine
geometry reader but it is lossy in two ways that matter for assemblies.

1. It MANGLES names. `get_name` runs `translate(str.maketrans(" .()", "____"))`
   to appease an unrelated viewer, so a product the file calls "M3 Nut (x20)"
   comes back as "M3_Nut__x20_". Since the whole point of keeping the assembly
   tree is showing the user the names their CAD system wrote, that is the one
   thing that cannot be lossy.
2. Its `.children` are NOT world-placed. `Shape.move` mutates only the parent
   compound's TopLoc_Location, so harvesting a leaf's `.wrapped` from a
   `.children` walk yields it in its PARENT's frame. Measured on a depth-3
   fixture: the same subassembly instanced twice 50mm apart produced two leaves
   with identical bounding boxes. Composing locations while walking XCAF avoids
   ever creating that hazard, rather than guarding against it afterwards.

Reading XCAF directly also removes a structural risk. Only the XCAF layer knows
which compounds are assemblies and which are multi-solid products, both are
TopAbs_COMPOUND to OCCT, so any design that reads structure from one tree and
geometry from another has to keep two walks in lockstep. On the reference file
493 of 1,293 leaf products are compounds, i.e. exactly the nodes where such
walks diverge. One walk, one source of truth.

This module owns no geometry operations; it reads and returns shapes.
